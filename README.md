# Google-Wave-Notifier

## Important Notice - 24th Sept 2010
It looks like a recent change to Google Wave has stopped Google Wave Notifier from working reliably. I've been unable to find a way around this (it looks like the authentication has totally changed), so it looks like Google Wave Notifier is no longer useful. If you find it still works for you, please let [me](http://twitter.com/DanTup) know!

## Google Wave Notifier
Google Wave Notifier sits in the notification area of your Windows PC and notifies you of unread messages in your Google Wave account with a balloon notification.

## Supported Languages
Below is a list of languages that Google Wave Notifier has been translated into. It'll automatically detect the language from your operating system, but this can be overriden in the settings dialog.

  * English
  * Czech
  * Danish
  * Dutch
  * French
  * German
  * Hungarian
  * Italian
  * Polish
  * Portuguese
  * Romanian
  * Russian
  * Spanish
  * Swedish
  * Turkish

## Requirements
Google Wave Notifier requires the .NET Framework 3.5 SP 1.

## Disclaimer
This is not an official Google application. I'm not affiliated with Google in any way. I'm just a fan of Wave and decided to release this to help encourage others to use Wave!
